2. Sign up with a `@gatech.edu` email address.
3. Check your email. :tada:

Can't get in? **Don't panic.** The following steps are rumored to be useful.

1. Panicking.
2. Signing out, clearing cookies, and trying to sign back in.
3. Checking your spam folder for Slack's "magic link."
4. Contacting `@areyes37`.

### Community Guidelines

1. Don't share large files, like `zip` and `pdf` files.
2. Be nice and keep it professional.
3. Don't use `@everyone` or `@channel`. Your classmates live in different timezones.
4. Don't violate the [honor code](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code). Your TA's are probably in the same channel.
5. We're on the free tier, so we have limited integrations (10). Chances are, your integration request to add all cat pictures to a private Dropbox folder will be rejected. If it doesn't help the whole community, it likely doesn't deserve a spot in the Top 10.
