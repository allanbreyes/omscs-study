### How to Join

1. Visit the [signup page](https://omscs-study.slack.com/signup).
2. Sign up with a `@gatech.edu` email address.
3. Check your email. :tada:

Can't get in? **Don't panic.** The following steps are rumored to be useful:

1. Panicking.
2. Signing out, clearing cookies, and trying to sign back in.
3. Checking your spam folder for Slack's "magic link."
4. Emailing `areyes37 at gatech dot edu`

### Community Guidelines

1. **Don't share private files.**
2. Don't share large files, like `zip` and `pdf` files.
3. Be nice and keep it professional.
4. Don't use `@everyone` or `@channel`. Your classmates live in different timezones.
5. Don't violate the [honor code](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code). Your TA's are probably in the same channel.
6. We're on the free tier, so we have limited integrations (10). Chances are, your integration request to add all cat pictures to a private Dropbox folder will be rejected. If it doesn't help the whole community, it likely doesn't deserve a spot in the Top 10.

### File Space

We have limited storage for file shares. If you notice that we've hit the limit early (happens near the end of semesters), please contact an admin (see below). Otherwise, a scheduled job, [`file-purger`](https://github.com/omscs-study/file-purger), runs *daily* to delete all files older than *10 days*.

### Issues

We take a pretty light hand towards administration and moderation, but if you
have any issues, e.g. harassment or abuse, you can contact the admins:

- `@allan`
- `@arkaaito`

> If you encounter any issues with [Honor Code](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code) violations, it's recommended that you contact your course staff directly.

### Privacy

Certain channels that have opted in to archiving and have the `@archivebot` user present persist _all_ messages (but not files), which for... reasons... are *publicly available*. It's recommended not to share any sensitive or personal information in any channel, but more so in archiving ones.
